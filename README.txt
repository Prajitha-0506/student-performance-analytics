# Project 2: Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

# Problem Statement
Educational institutions require early warning systems to identify students at risk of failing or dropping out.

# Objective
Analyze student data to visualize performance trends and create a dashboard that highlights struggling students.

# Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

# Steps Followed
1. Imported and loaded student performance dataset.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and checked for nulls.
3. Performed correlation analysis between GPA, attendance, and behavioral metrics.
4. Visualized key relationships using boxplots, scatter plots, and histograms.
5. Created a custom 'At_Risk_Flag' based on GPA, attendance, and mental health score.
6. Filtered and displayed students who are likely at risk.

# Output
- GPA vs Dropout Risk distribution
- Attendance vs GPA scatter plot
- Mental Health distribution by dropout risk
- Table of flagged students

# Conclusion
The dashboard helps institutions detect struggling students early, enabling timely academic or emotional support.

# Recommendations
- Provide additional academic help to low GPA students.
- Offer counseling sessions to those with low attendance or poor mental health.
